       <h2>How they came to be</h2>
         <div id="child1">
           <p>One of their greatest strengths lies with their numbers. Usually they move in large groups which may compensate for any weaknesses. Some reports, mention extreme muscle strength exceeding by far that of humans. ... Depending on the stage of decay, the skin, muscles, and tissue of zombies can be easily damaged.

      <h2>Anatomy</h2>
        <div id ="child2">
           <p>The traditional undead zombie has the same anatomy as a non-infected human. However, when the human is transformed into the zombie, significant changes happen to the body. The most obvious change is the fact that they are deceased yet still moving. This change is what gives the zombie it’s greatest power and weaknesses.
               Because the zombie is essentially dead, there is no need for organs to support it’s life functions. Destruction of the heart or other vital organs will have no effect of the zombie. As many of you know, the brain must be destroyed in order to “kill” the undead. Zombies do not feel pain and have no fear of you whatsoever. They cannot be demoralized and they will stop at nothing to feed on you.
               The biggest weakness of the zombie is that they no longer have higher brain function. They also lack coordination, speed, problem solving abilities and situational awareness. Zombies are essentially a machine with one purpose, to feed. Using your head in a zombie survival situation is what will get you through safely. The second you panic or have not prepared for this inevitable outbreak, you give up your greatest advantage.
